The Department of microbiological research **(OMR)** at the National laboratory of health, environment and food is a center of excellence for microbiome research. We are developing diverse approaches to study C. difficile interactions with gut microbiota. The methodological knowledge is also transferred to analyses of complex populations in clinical relevant and other ecosystems. Department is lead by Prof. Maja Rupnik since 2004.
